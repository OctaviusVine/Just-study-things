Task: the most frequent symbol
A line of text is supplied to the program as input. I wrote a program that displays the symbol that appears most often.
'''

s = input()
count_main = 0
the_most_often_symbol = ""
for i in range(len(s)):
    count_add = 0
    count_add += s.count(s[i])
    if count_add >= count_main:
        count_main = count_add
        the_most_often_symbol = s[i]
print(the_most_often_symbol)
