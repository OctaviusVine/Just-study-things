Task: deleting a fragment
The program is fed a line of text in which the letter "h" occurs at least twice. 
I wrote a program that removes the first and last occurrence of the letter "h" from this string, as well as all the characters between them.

s = input()
print(s[:s.find("h")], s[s.rfind("h") + 1:], sep="")
