Task from exam on the topic "strings"
Upheaval
The input to the program is a line of text in which the letter "h" occurs at least twice.
I wrote a program that returns the original string and reverses the sequence of characters enclosed between the first and last occurrence of the letter "h".
'''

s = input()
print(s[0: s.find("h")], s[s.rfind("h"):s.find("h"): -1], s[s.rfind("h"):], sep="")

'''
for example: the program will process next input in the following way
abch12345h
abch54321h
