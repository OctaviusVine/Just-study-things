Task: first and last occurrence

A line of text is supplied to the program as input. If the letter "f" occurs only once in this line, its index is output. 
If it occurs two or more times, the index of its first and last occurrence is displayed on the same line, separated by a space character. 
If the letter "f" does not occur in this line, "NO" is output.

    print(s.index("f"))
elif count_f >= 2:
    print(s.index("f"), s.rindex("f"))
elif count_f == 0:
