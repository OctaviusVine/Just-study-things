'''
Task: divisors-1
The program is fed two natural numbers aa and bb (a < b) as input. 
I wrote a program that finds a natural number from the segment [a; b] with the maximum sum of divisors.
'''

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
largest = 0
summ_count = 0
for i in range(a, b + 1):
    summ = 0
    for j in range(1, i + 1):
        if i % j == 0:
            summ += j
            if summ >= summ_count:
                summ_count = summ
                largest = i
print(largest, summ_count)
