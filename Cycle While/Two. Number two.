the number of digits in it;
the product of its digits;
the arithmetic mean of its digits;
its first digit;
the sum of its first and last digits.

n = int(input())
lastf = n % 10
summ = 0
amount = 0
mult = 1
while n != 0:
    last_digit = n % 10
    summ += last_digit
    amount += 1
    mult *= last_digit
    n = n // 10
    if 0 < n < 10:
        firstf = n
print(summ)
print(amount)
print(mult)
print(summ / amount)
print(firstf)
print(firstf + lastf)
