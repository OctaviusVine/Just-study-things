Task: follow the rules

The input to the program is a natural number nn. I wrote a program that outputs numbers from 1 to n inclusive with the exception of:
numbers from 55 to 99 inclusive;
numbers from 17 to 37 inclusive;
numbers from 78 to 87 inclusive.
'''

n = int(input())
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if  9 >= i >= 5 or 37 >= i >= 17 or 87 >= i >= 78:
        continue
    print(i)
